neuralnetwork
=============

A **simple** python neural network to analyse data from diabetic patients in 130 US hospitals [1].
The architecture of the network is flexible (number of layers, input and output units).
The neural network classifies using regularized logistic regression. The gradients are computed with backpropagation and are checked numerically. The network is optimized with the scipy.optimize.fmin_cg algorithm. When several regularization parameters are used, the optimization is parallelized. Finally, learning curves are computed to evaluate the performance of the neural network.

Dependencies: [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [joblib](https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/).

In the initial stage of development I used functions from this [repository](https://github.com/subokita/mlclass/blob/master/ex4.py).
